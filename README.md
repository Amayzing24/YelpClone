# Yelp Clone
This project is a full stack Yelp clone using PostgreSQL, Express, React, and Node JS (PERN stack). The foundation was built following a tutorial from Sanjeev Thiyagarajan on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01rYl9T3BU" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp</a>. The project provides the ability to add, edit, delete, and search for restaurants, as well as add ratings and comments.

To run the client side, navigate to the `client` directory in the terminal and run `npm start`. To run the backend, navigate to the `server` directory and run `npm start`.
